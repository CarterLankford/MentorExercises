## Game plan

This section outlines the overall set of guidelines regarding the logistics of the mentoring: session, communications, etc. 
They are subject to adjustment at discression of the involved parties.

1. Mentoring sessions are to be help twice a week (agreed days: Tuesdays and Thursdays)
2. The sessions are held without agenda, but with focus on question solving, review of advance and discussion of new concepts/topics
3. The session days have a general purpose as defined below:
	* Tuesdays: follow up on current assignments, review of any pending questions or doubts
	* Thursdays: target day for deliverables, closing of issues/assignments and start of new issues/assignments
4. Use of GitHub issues and pull request to give feedback on advance is preferred (to preserve a record of discussed topics)
5. Use of Kitestring slack, or email is allowed and encouraged for more urgent matters

## Assignments and Issue tracking 

All new assignments will be entered onto this repository as [issues](https://github.com/CarterLankford/MentorExercises/issues), with the following categories:

* Algorithms: These correspond to problems that require ingenuity and creativity in providing a repeatable, efficient solution to a problem
* Java Exercises: These correspond to language specific problems and programming concepts
* Logic Problems: These correspond to challenges that do not require coding, but help to deepen the understanding of programming in general

And whatever new categories are needed according to the topic being discussed (i.e. Data Structures)

## Tags

The following tag groups are provided [in the repo](https://github.com/CarterLankford/MentorExercises/labels) to help identify all issues created (including pull requests for any code submission):

### Status

These labels help identify the workflow of a given issue:

* `0-Backlog`: It's in the to-do list
* `1-Blocked`: This issue is on hold and can't be continued for the moment
* `1-Pending`: This issue requires more information before continuing
* `2-Work in Progress`: This issue is being actively worked on
* `3-Canceled`: This issue will no longer be done
* `3-Done`: Issue has been completed successfully

### Type

These labels help identifying the type of issue being created or being resolved:

* `Bug`: This issue represents a bug in the code or something that needs to be fixed. This bug wasn't caught as part of a review before.
* `Bugfix`: This is mostly for pull requests, to identify that the changes on this PR are to solve an issue
* `Challenge`: These issues contain logic problems that are aimed to deepen the understanding on a particular concept. They may or may not have code assigned to them
* `Feature`: This is a new functionality to be created/added

### Priority

These labels are used to reflect the urgency of an issue (in the case of bugs found that need immediate attention) and to organize the order in which issues are going to be resolved (on any given moment, more than one issue might be created), being `P1` the highest priority.

## Tech Stack

The following list reflects the tools needed during the session and in some cases the versions preferred (as of 06/03/2019).
