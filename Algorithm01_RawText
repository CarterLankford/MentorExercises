:: Challenge :: 
How would you find the number of maximum consecutive 1’s in an array (not a string) of only 0’s and 1’s?

An example array: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

In this case the output is: 3


:: Response ::

if a 1 is found trigger a count
add one to count 
once a zero or end of the array is found, end count
if another one is found add one to new count
once a zero or end of the array is found, end count
then compare with last count, if bigger new largest count is this.

maximum consecuitive 1's = int
current consecuitive 1's = int

for each x in array 
    if (x == 1) 
        current consecuitive 1's + 1

    else if ( x == 0 && current consecuitive 1's > 0)
        if (current consecuitive 1's > maximum consecuitive 1's)
            maximum consecuitive 1's = current consecuitive 1's
        else 
            current consecuitive 1's = 0
